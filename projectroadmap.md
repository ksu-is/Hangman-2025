- [✓] look for exisiting code that relates to hangman
- [✓] evaluate the repository; is it considered "good" coding?
- [✓] download the repo and pygame
- [✓] run the code and test it out
- [✓] observe what happens after running the code
- [✓] are there errors? if so document them
- [✓] if you were able to run the code, how did you do it?
- [✓] analyze if the repo is well documented
- [ ] see if there needs to be any modifications in the explaination
- [ ] write instructions and suggest changes through project maintainer

When I ran the code an error occured. The terminal said "module 'Pygame' not found"
I tried to enter "pip install pygame" into the IDLE but there was no pip function found
While researching solutions I found a YouTube video created by Coding With Russ. It said to check if Python and pip was correctly installed by opening the command prompt and typing "Python" and then "pip" after. If an error message popped up this indicated I incorrectly installed the Python application. To fix this, I uninstalled the current version of Python I had and then redownloaded it from the original site. Once downloaded, I opened the application and a winodow showed the options "Use admin priviledges when isntalling py.exe" and "Add python.exe to PATH". The video advised to check the box with the "Add python.exe to PATH" to fix the issue. I then reopened the command prompt window, checked to see if Python was installed properly, and then entered "pip install pygame".
